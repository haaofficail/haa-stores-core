# Execution Checklist — Post-QA Autopilot (final)

> Live status of each wave. Final snapshot after autopilot run on `autopilot/post-qa-execution`.

---

## Mandatory Skill Gate Checklist (pre-execution — required for every task)

> Run this checklist BEFORE any edit. It is the operational form of
> AGENTS.md §14. Empty boxes = task not yet eligible to start.
>
> "Skills" = Claude Code execution skills in `.claude/skills/`. NOT CSS,
> tokens, or visual UI work.

- [ ] Task classified into one of the 13 task types (AGENTS.md §14.4)
- [ ] 1–4 skills selected from `docs/agent-os/SKILLS_REGISTRY.md`
- [ ] Each skill has a one-line "why it fits" justification
- [ ] Expected files listed (paths or globs)
- [ ] Verification commands mapped per selected skill
- [ ] Risk level assigned (low / medium / high)
- [ ] Final Skill Compliance Report template loaded
      (`docs/agent-os/templates/SKILL_COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md`)
- [ ] Safety constraints reviewed (AGENTS.md §14.7) — no deploy,
      no `db:migrate`, no secrets, no production action, no forbidden server
      `187.124.41.239`
- [ ] Mandatory Skill Gate block published in the response BEFORE first edit
- [ ] `pnpm check:skills` passes locally

Once every box is ticked, proceed to the task type's specific gates below
(e.g. for `database/migration` start with `environment-safety-gate`; for
`frontend/design` start with `design-ux-excellence-gate`).

If no skill fits, follow AGENTS.md §14.3 (declare `**No matching skill
found**`, pick fallback, log Pending addition in
`docs/agent-os/SKILLS_REGISTRY.md`).

## Phase 3 — Autopilot resumption from W0
