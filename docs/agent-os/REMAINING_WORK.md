# Remaining Work — Launch Readiness

> Updated after each engineering follow-up.
> The post-QA autopilot is fully closed. This is the **launch-readiness** tracker.

---

## Last Completed

- **Task:** Phase-2 closure (PRs #161 → #185) + migrations 0083+0084+0085 applied on staging + `AUTH_LEGACY_VERIFIED=0` flipped.
- **Last commit:** see `docs/HAA_TASK_LEDGER.md` §5 Update Log for the latest dated entries.
- **Verification:** every shipped PR carries its own verification block (typecheck + lint + unit + regression). The Aug-grade staging deploys passed via the hardened `deploy.yml` (PR #183).
- **Notes:** Phase 1 email-verification loop is **closed**. Phase 2 (transactional emails + billing reminders + legal entity + deploy hardening) is **shipped to main + applied to staging**. Phase 3 starts with the 22-wave Autopilot, beginning at W0 (this commit).

## Engineering follow-ups landed on `main` (PRs #39 → #60)

## Remaining — Owner-gated only

These cannot be progressed by engineering code; they need owner action (legal, credentials, infrastructure approval).

### Compliance gates (G1–G10)

- [x] **G1** — Commercial Registration ✅ provided 2026-06-24: مؤسسة حرف الهاء التجارية, CR `7038798612`, issued 2024-04-08, status نشط. Wired into the platform via PR #181. Unblocks G6 + G9.
- [ ] **G2** — VAT / ZATCA registration.
- [ ] **G3** — E-commerce license. Owner states the license exists as of 2026-06-28; license number/copy or approved reference is still pending before this can be marked closed.
- [ ] **G4** — DPO (Data Protection Officer) appointed.
- [ ] **G5** — Trademark / علامة تجارية registered.
- [ ] **G6** — PCI-DSS ASV scan (depends on G1).
- [ ] **G7** — Penetration testing engagement.
- [ ] **G8** — KSA hosting decision (current server `72.61.108.208` is outside KSA — DECISION-OS-007 locks the server; the residency decision is separate).
- [ ] **G9** — Tabby DPA signed (depends on G1).
- [ ] **G10** — Disaster Recovery plan + tabletop exercise.

### Infrastructure / credentials

- [ ] **Cloudflare DNS** for `haastores.com` per DECISION-OS-008. Zone not in the connected Hostinger MCP account (404). Without DNS, no production TLS, no production launch.
- [ ] **Production secrets** — `JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL` etc. per `docs/ops/PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md §2`. Plus GitHub `production` environment secrets in repo settings.
- [ ] **Geidea live credentials** — endpoints, signature rules, API keys. Capability flags currently disabled (Wave 4).
- [ ] **Shipping live credentials** — owner picks provider (Aramex / OTO / SMSA / Saudi Post) and supplies credentials.
- [ ] **Wallet idempotency migration execution** — owner approval to run `pnpm db:migrate` against staging then production. The migration file + ledger code path + tests are already on `main` (PR #42).

### Operational hardening (engineering scaffolding exists; owner connects)

- [ ] **Redis / BullMQ queue** — `/api/health` currently reports `queue: degraded, mode=noop`. `QUEUE_REDIS_URL` is set but bullmq can't connect; jobs are not durable. Owner provisions a managed Redis (or fixes the existing one) and verifies the queue switches to the real backend.
- [ ] **Monitoring / Sentry** — observability shim is wired (`apps/api/src/services/observability.ts`); owner provides `SENTRY_DSN` for the staging + production environments and installs `@sentry/node` so the shim swaps from no-op to real.
- [ ] **Backups + restore drill** — automate DB backups (cron + retention policy), document a restore runbook, schedule the first restore drill. Required input for G10.
- [ ] **Transactional email** — pick provider (Postmark / SES / SendGrid), configure SPF / DKIM / DMARC for the sending domain, wire credentials.
- [x] **2FA + self-serve password reset engineering** — TASK-0125 added TOTP enrollment + verify on `/admin/login` and sensitive admin operations, plus admin-owned password reset request/confirm. Owner-only rollout remains below.
- [x] **Admin auth staging rollout prerequisites** — TASK-0129 applied `0090_admin_totp.sql` on staging, set/rotated `ADMIN_TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` through the official staging env workflow, restarted API, and verified admin staging + `/health`. Staging health reports SMTP email configured.
- [ ] **Admin auth production rollout prerequisites** — production migration/key rollout remains owner-gated and was not touched by TASK-0129.
- [x] **Admin Webhooks/Idempotency operational UI** — TASK-0127 added `/operations/webhooks` for `webhooks.read` admins, consuming existing webhook event, dedup-stats, and idempotency-key stats routes.
- [ ] **Deployment smoke + rollback** — add post-deploy smoke tests (curl `/api/health` + a fixed login flow) plus a one-command rollback script that re-deploys the previous image tag.

### Sandbox preparation track

- [x] **Sandbox rehearsal checklist** — owner selected sandbox preparation on 2026-06-28. `docs/ops/SANDBOX_REHEARSAL_CHECKLIST.md` defines local mock and conditional staging sandbox paths for fake/sandbox payment and mock/sandbox shipping without live calls, secrets, production deploy, or `db:migrate`.
- [x] **Local mock rehearsal test baseline** — TASK-0090 ran the focused payment/shipping mock command from `docs/ops/SANDBOX_REHEARSAL_CHECKLIST.md`; 10 files / 151 tests passed.
- [ ] **Local app smoke rehearsal** — start local dev services intentionally and exercise fake payment + manual/haa_mock shipping through browser/API smoke without live providers.
- [ ] **Staging sandbox approval packet** — collect owner approval plus approved secret-path confirmation for Geidea and OTO sandbox credentials before any staging sandbox run.

## Forbidden / Owner-only — unchanged

- [ ] live payments (any provider)
- [ ] live shipping (any provider)
- [ ] production deploy
- [ ] `pnpm db:migrate` against any database
- [ ] secrets / `.env*` / `.hostinger-mcp.env`
- [ ] server `187.124.41.239` (forbidden for Haa Stores)
- [ ] DNS records on `haastores.com` (Cloudflare-managed per DECISION-OS-008)
- [ ] root-level legacy reports (DECISION-OS-001 — cleanup is a dedicated PR)
