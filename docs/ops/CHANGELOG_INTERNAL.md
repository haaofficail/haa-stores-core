### Changed

- AGENTS.md: from design-system-focused skill guide to full project constitution with 12 sections
- CURRENT_STATE.md: updated with System Health OS completion
- TASK_TRACKER.md: added TASK-0002 for System Health OS

### Fixed

- Git repository initialized (commit `076bc40` — "chore: add development operating system")
- Path verification confirmed: all Dev OS files in correct project root only

### Notes

- This is the foundational commit of the Development Operating System
- All future work must follow the Mandatory Start Rule defined in AGENTS.md
- System Health OS adds proactive monitoring before merchant reports
- Remaining gap: `preflight` Root Guard does not fail when run from wrong directory; needs hardening
- Synthetic checks warn if dev servers are not running (expected behavior)

## 2026-06-13 (Hardening Pass)

### Added

- Created `.haa-project-root` marker file
- Created `scripts/preflight.mjs` — hardened Node-based preflight with exit code 1 on failure

### Changed

- `package.json` preflight: from inline shell script to `node scripts/preflight.mjs`
- `scripts/monitor-health.mjs`: removed `/api/health` check (only uses `/health`)
- `scripts/synthetic-checks.mjs`: removed `/api/health` check (only uses `/health`)
- `docs/ops/HEALTH_CHECKS.md`: fixed duplicate sections, documented `/health` as sole endpoint
- RISK_REGISTER: R-0001 (wrong directory) status changed to Mitigated

### Fixed

- Root Guard now exits with code 1 from wrong directory (hardened)
- Monitoring report no longer shows Degraded due to `/api/health` 404
